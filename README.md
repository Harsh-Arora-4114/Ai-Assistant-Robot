# AI Assistant Robot

## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of various hardware components to create an AI-powered assistant robot. The system is built around an **Arduino Uno** microcontroller, which coordinates operations between voice recognition, visual feedback, and manual control inputs.

## Components Used
### 1. **Arduino Uno**
   - Acts as the central processing unit to control the robot's functions.

### 2. **VC 2 Voice Command Module**
   - Captures voice inputs via a built-in microphone.
   - Processes commands and triggers actions accordingly.

### 3. **Speaker**
   - Outputs audio responses or feedback from the robot.

### 4. **OLED Display (128x64 pixels)**
   - Displays facial expressions or status updates.

### 5. **Breadboard & Circuit Board**
   - Organizes wiring and connections for smooth integration of components.

### 6. **Two NO (Normally Open) Buttons**
   - Provide manual control or programming options.

## Setup and Wiring
The wiring is designed to interconnect all components efficiently:
- The **VC 2 Module** connects to both the Arduino and the **Speaker** to handle voice recognition and audio responses.
- The **OLED Display** is connected to display robot expressions based on input and status.
- The **Buttons** are wired to allow manual input for user interaction or robot configuration.

## Features
- **Voice command recognition** to control the robot hands-free.
- **Audio feedback** for interactive responses.
- **Visual representation** using an OLED screen for expressions.
- **Manual control options** via push buttons.

## How to Use
1. **Assemble the hardware** following the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload the Arduino code** to the microcontroller.
3. **Power the system**, and the robot will be ready to respond to voice commands.
4. **Use the OLED screen** for real-time feedback and expressions.
5. **Manually trigger actions** using the push buttons if needed.
