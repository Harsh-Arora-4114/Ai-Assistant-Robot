# Ai-Assistant-Robot
AI-Assistant Robot setup, illustrating the integration of various components on a breadboard and circuit board. Central to the setup is an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which orchestrates the operations of the robot. It is connected to a breadboard that facilitates the organization and connection of different components. A key component is the VC 2 Module for voice command recognition, which includes a microphone for capturing voice inputs. This module is mounted on a separate circuit board and connected to a speaker, which likely outputs audio responses or feedback.
Additionally, the setup includes an OLED screen with a resolution of 128x64 pixels, intended to display facial expressions, thereby providing a visual representation of the robot's responses or status. Two buttons, labeled "NO" (normally open), are also connected to the breadboard, suggesting manual input options for controlling or programming the robot. The wiring between these components indicates a well-organized configuration that enables the robot to receive and process voice commands, produce audio output, and display visual feedback.
